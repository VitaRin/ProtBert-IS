# ProtBert-IS

Relevant files used in the fine-tuning of ProtBert for protein solubilty prediction.

> That includes:
>  
> - Testing files that read protein sequences from a .fasta file and produce a prediction output.
> - Code used to create the custom dataset.
> - Custom training and testing datasets.
> - The Python file used for training the models. 

The code used for fine tuning was adapted from the original ProtBert GitHub: https://github.com/agemagician/ProtTrans/blob/master/Fine-Tuning/ProtBert_BFD_FineTuning_MS.ipynb
